# CNN_FINGERPRINT_RECONSTRUCTION_MODEL
A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to reconstruct and enhance degraded fingerprint images. The model restores ridge clarity from noisy, blurred, or low-quality inputs, improving biometric recognition accuracy for security and forensic applications.
